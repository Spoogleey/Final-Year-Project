# Final-Year-Project
This is my final year project that I created for university. It is a prototype website that includes a text editor and utilises the ChatGPT API within a pop-out menu. This was made to help writers to overcome slumps by implementing a way for them to generate text and image responses, to help them visualise what they may be wanting to write about.

Access to the website can be found here: https://w20009414.nuwebspace.co.uk/HomePage.html
The code uploaded does not contain the ChatGPT API key for security reasons, but all other code is available. Use the link above to view the prototype website with the working ChatGPT API implementation.
